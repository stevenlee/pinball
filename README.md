# pinball
Pinball machine for learning math

### Controller
  Arduino UNO

### Display
  Use LED to show the probability of each lane.
  Because the limitation of IO count of Arduino, we need 74HC595 shift registers to expand the IO

### Counting
  IR : hard to tune the detection distance
  Force sensor : The marble is not heavy enough
  Microswitch : 

### Tooling
  Arduino compiling environment
  Oscilloscope
